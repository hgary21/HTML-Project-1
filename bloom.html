	<p>
		Bloom is a post processing effect that blurs bright parts of the HDR render to achieve a glowing visual effect.
		This allows objects brighter than the traditional brightest color, RGB 255 255 255, to appear even brighter by
		affecting neighboring pixels. This effect is usually implemented with a <em>Gaussian Blur</em> after a
		luminosity threshold step.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is difficult to apply bloom during the main rendering process because the <em>Gaussian Blur</em> layers
		require access to neighboring pixel's information, which might not be immediately available. Hence, bloom is
		most often implemented as a post processing effect, meaning it is applied after the majority of the render is
		completed. While post processing effects cannot directly read critical data about the scene and material, they
		can still use the depth buffer and other intermediate rendering passes which provide sufficent information to
		efficently calculate or approximate many photorealistic effects like bloom.
